# YearSums
 Simple (and stupid) notebook relating to a reddit post adding dates seeing patterns. 
Inspired by [this reddit post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/comments/ta7fu9/were_done_for/. )


### Formula: 
` Year Sum = Day + Month + Two First Digits Of Year + Two Last Digits Of Year `

For instance: 
31. January 1956 would be:

```python
31 + 1 + 19 + 56
# 107
```
